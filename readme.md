Depending on personal strategy, it will either save your time or increase incomes by giving a significant advantage in ability to rely on SkinHunter's background service instead of daily seeking of profitable offers.

  ``` 
  MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-key.keystore
  MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
  MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=******
  MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=******* 
  ```
    and then 
    ```
  ./gradlew assembleRelease
  ```
  Please note, even tho release error with 'duplicated assets' is not reproducing now, you may need to delete warned assets of react-native-navigation manually if error occurs. (ctrl+clink on every warned asset in VScode console will navigate to asset path)

### Configuring service

### Settings
- At the top you can see you current profile information and balance in USD if you're logged or a suggestion to Log In if you're unlogged now.
- 'Should display...' switch defines if only offers that were created during the service will be shown. May be useful to get rid of outdated offers that passed filters. If NO, alredy existed offers will be shown, but ofc you will not be notificated about that.
- 'Delay' switch allows to basically select delay between each request to server. As rate limits that noticed in API documentation seems to be uncorrect, application provides custom values based on author usage experience.

## FAQ
### Is this even safe?
- Yes, your keys are never stored unencrypted. Application uses react-native-keychain to store credentials. Application gets keys from encrypted storage and passes them to temporary storage each time application starts. 
- If you're still afraid, feel free to create a new empty account on dmarket and use API keys from there. It requires only email.
